Features
High-accuracy fingerprint recognition (99% success rate).
Real-time user authentication for seamless access.
OLED display for intuitive status updates.
Low power consumption for sustainable operation.
Future potential for additional features like time tracking and integration with library management systems.
Technologies Used
ESP32: The core microcontroller for managing operations.
Fingerprint Scanner Module: For capturing and verifying fingerprints.
OLED Display: For displaying user feedback and system status.
Embedded Systems: Ensures efficient interaction between hardware and software.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:

Hardware: ESP32, Fingerprint Scanner Module, OLED Display, jumper wires, and a breadboard or PCB.
Software: Arduino IDE for uploading the code.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biometric-library-access-system.git  
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd biometric-library-access-system  
Set up the hardware according to the provided circuit diagram.
Open the Arduino IDE and install necessary libraries (e.g., Adafruit GFX and Adafruit SSD1306 for the OLED).
Upload the code to the ESP32.
Usage
Power on the system.
Place your finger on the fingerprint scanner.
The OLED display will show:
Access Granted: If your fingerprint matches a registered user.
Access Denied: If no match is found.
Error Message: For any system issues.
